* DONE Free off-screen bullets back to the bullet pool
* DONE Create a bullet data type that wraps the bullet system and bullet id into one data structure
** DONE Create a BulletRef struct with member variables bullet and bullet_system
** DONE Change all bullet methods to take BulletRef as an argument instead of a bullet system and bullet index
* DONE Create some sane subdirectories for source and data files
* DONE Open port for a REPL so the program can be modified as it is running
* DONE Allow many types of bullet sprites
** DONE Create a sprite sheet struct with Guile bindings
** DONE Add a sprite sheet member variable to bullet system
** DONE Use sub-bitmaps of the sprite sheet to set bullet bitmaps
* DONE Add angular velocity to bullets
* TODO Stop using Euler integration
** Maybe...
* TODO Add a bounding box to the bullet system that specifies the bounds of the game area
** Bullets outside of this box are killed but right now it is hard-coded in remove_out_of_bounds_bullet
** DONE Add a bounding box struct
* TODO Add a counter to bullet system that counts active bullets
* DONE Rotate bullet sprites in the direction they are moving
* TODO Break Scheme code into modules
** TODO Coroutine module
** TODO Scheduler module
** TODO Bullet pattern primitives module
** TODO Yield functions module
* DONE Create some macros
** DONE Coroutine macro
* DONE Add keyboard event callbacks
** DONE Map allegro key codes to scheme symbols in a hash table
* DONE Add player and enemies
** No need for C here, this can be done on the Scheme side
* TODO Add collision detection
** DONE Collision between player and enemy bullets
** TODO Collision between player bullets and enemies
* TODO Develop actual gameplay :P
* DONE Refactor game loop into several smaller functions
* TODO Control FPS rendering from Scheme
** It's hard-coded in the game loop right now
* DONE Create font smob
* TODO Pick a C code formatting style and STICK TO IT FFS
* TODO Get rid of those annoying compiler warnings for scm_c_define_gsubr
** Need to talk to the folks on #guile about this
* TODO Improve bullet pool code
** Use a more efficient method to find unused bullets in the pool.
* TODO Refactor scheduler
** Use the srfi-9 records module
* TODO Add GPL snippet to every source file
* DONE Implement reference counting for bullets to prevent weird bugs
